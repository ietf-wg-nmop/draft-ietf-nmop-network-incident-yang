              draft-ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang-latest

Abstract

   A network incident refers to an unexpected interruption of a network
   service, degradation of a network service quality, or sub-health of a
   network service.  Different data sources including alarms, metrics,
   and other anomaly information can be aggregated into a few amount of
   network incidents by data correlation analysis and the service impact
   analysis.

   This document defines a YANG Module for the network incident
   lifecycle management.  This YANG module is meant to provide a
   standard way to report, diagnose, and help resolve network incidents
   for the sake of network service health and root cause analysis.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8969] defines a framework for Automating Service and Network
   Management with YANG [RFC7950] to full life cycle network management.
   A set of YANG data models have already been developed in IETF for
   network performance monitoring and fault monitoring, e.g., a YANG
   data model for alarm management [RFC8632] defines a standard
   interface for alarm management.  A data model for Network and VPN
   Service Performance Monitoring [RFC9375] defines a standard interface
   for network performance management.  In addition, distributed tracing
   mechanism defined in [W3C-Trace-Context] can be used to analyze and
   debug operations, such as configuration transactions, across multiple
   distributed systems.

   However, these YANG data models for network maintenance are based on
   specific data source information and manage alarms and performance
   metrics data separately by different layers in various different
   management systems.  In addition, the frequency and quantity of
   alarms and performance metrics data reported to Operating Support
   System (OSS) are increased dramatically (in many cases multiple
   orders of magnitude) with the growth of service types and complexity
   and greatly overwhelm OSS platforms; with existing known dependency
   relation between fault, alarm and events at each layer (e.g., packet
   layer or optical layer), it is possible to compress series of alarms
   into fewer incidents and there are many solutions in the market today
   that essentially do this to some degree.  However, conventional
   solutions such as data compression are time-consuming and labor-
   intensive, usually rely on maintenance engineers' experience for data
   analysis, which, in many cases, result in low processing efficiency,
   inaccurate root cause identification and duplicated tickets.  It is
   also difficult to assess the impact of alarms, performance metrics
   and other anomaly data on network services without known relation
   across layers of the network topology data or the relation with other
   network topology data.

   To address these challenges, a network wide incident-centric solution
   is specified to establish the dependency relation with both network
   service and network topology at different layers, which not only can
   be used at a specific layer in a domain but also can be used to span
   across layers for multi-layer network troubleshooting.

   A network incident refers to an undesired occurence such as an
   unexpected interruption of a network service,degradation of a network
   service quality, or sub-health of a network service
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology][TMF724A].  Different data sources
   including alarms, metrics, and other anomaly information can be
   aggregated into one or a few amount of incidents irrespective layer
   by correlation analysis and the service impact analysis.  For
   example, if the protocol-related interface fails to work properly,
   large amount of alarms may be reported to upper layer management
   system since a lot of network services may be affected by the
   interface, but only one aggregated incident regarding the abnormal
   interface will be reported.  An incident may also be raised through
   the analysis of some network performance metrics, for example, as
   described in SAIN [RFC9417], network services can be decomposed to
   several sub-services, specific metrics are monitored for each sub-
   service, symptoms will occur if services/sub-services are unhealthy
   (after analyzing metrics), these symptoms may raise one incident when
   it causes degradation of the network services.

   In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
   are key technologies in the processing of large amounts of data with
   complex data correlations.  For example, Neural Network Algorithm or
   Hierarchy Aggregation Algorithm can be used to replace manual alarm
   data correlation.  Through online and offline learning, these
   algorithms can be continuously optimized to improve the efficiency of
   fault diagnosis.

   This document defines a YANG data model for network incident
   lifecycle management, which improves troubleshooting efficiency,
   ensures network service quality, and improves network automation
   [RFC8969].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8632] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  alarm

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Network incident:  An occurrence that is not desired/required (as it
      may be indicative of a future undesired State)
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   Problem:  A state regarded as undesirable and may require remedial
      action.  It is the cause of one or more incidents.  The cause is
      not usually known when a problem record is created.
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   Incident management:  Lifecycle management of incidents, including
      incident identification, reporting, acknowledgement, diagnosis,
      and resolution.

   Incident management system:  An entity which implements incident
      management.  It includes (but not limited to) incident management
      server and incident management client.

   Incident management server:  An entity which provides which is
      responsible for detecting an incident, performing incident
      diagnosis, resolution and prediction, etc.

   Incident management client:  An entity which can manage incidents.
      For example, it can receive incident notifications, query the
      information of incidents, instruct an incident management server
      to diagnose, help resolve, etc.

3.  Sample Use Cases

3.1.  Incident-Based Trouble Tickets Dispatching

   Usually, the dispatching of trouble tickets in a network is mostly
   based on alarms data analysis and needs to involve operators'
   maintenance engineers.  These operators' maintenance engineers are
   responsible to monitor and detect and correlate some alarms, e.g.,
   that alarms at both endpoints of a specific tunnel or at both optical
   and IP layers which are associated with the same network fault.
   Therefore, they can correlate these alarms to the same trouble
   ticket, which is in the low automation.  If there are more alarms,
   then the human costs for network maintenance are increased
   accordingly.

   Some operators preconfigure accept-lists and adopt some coarse
   granularity data correlation rules for the alarm management.  This
   approach seems to improve fault management automation.  However, some
   trouble tickets might be missed if the filtering conditions are too
   strict.  If the filtering conditions are not strict, it might end up
   with multiple trouble tickets being dispatched to the same network
   fault.  It is hard to achieve a perfect balance between the network
   management automation and duplicated trouble tickets under the
   conventional working situations.

   With the help of the network incident management, massive alarms can
   be aggregated into a few network incidents based on service impact
   analysis, the number of trouble tickets will be reduced.  At the same
   time, the efficiency of network troubleshooting can be largely
   improved. which address the pain point of traditional trouble ticket
   dispatching.

3.2.  Incident Derivation from L3VPN Services Unavailability

   The Service Attachment Points (SAPs) defined in [RFC9408] represent
   the network reference points where network services can be delivered
   or are being delivered to customers.

   SLOs can be used to characterize the ability of a particular set of
   nodes to communicate according to certain measurable expectations
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-pam].  For example, an SLA might state that any given
   SLO applies to at least a certain percentage of packets, allowing for
   a certain level of packet loss and exceeding packet delay threshold
   to take place.  For example, an SLA might establish a multi-tiered
   SLO of end-to-end latency as follows:

   *  Not to exceed 30 ms for any packet.

   *  Not to exceed 25 ms for 99.999% of packets.

   *  Not to exceed 20 ms for 99% of packets.

   This SLA information can be bound with two or multiple SAPs defined
   in [RFC9408], so that the service orchestration layer can use these
   interfaces to commit the delivery of a service on specific point-to-
   point service topology or point to multi-point topology.  When
   specific levels of a threshold of an SLO is violated, a specific
   network incident, associated with, let's say L3VPN service will be
   derived.

3.3.  Multi-layer Fault Demarcation

   When a fault occurs in a network that contains both packet-layer
   devices and optical-layer devices, it may cause correlative faults in
   both layers, i.e., packet layer and optical layer.  Specifically,
   fault propagation could be classified into three typical types.
   First, fault occurs at a packet-layer device will further cause fault
   (e.g., Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) client fault) at an
   optical-layer device.  Second, fault occurs at an optical-layer
   device will further cause fault (e.g., Layer 3 link down) at a
   packet- layer device.  Third, fault occurs at the inter-layer link
   between a packet-layer device and an optical-layer device will
   further cause faults at both devices.  Multiple operation teams are
   usually needed to first analyze huge amount of alarms (triggered by
   the above mentioned faults) from single network layer (either packet
   layer or optical layer)independently, then cooperate to locate the
   root cause through manually analyzing multi-layer topology data and
   service data, thus fault demarcation becomes more complex and time-
   consuming in multi-layer scenario than in single-layer scenario.

   With the help of network incident management, the management systems
   first automatically analyze root cause of the alarms at each single
   network layer and report corresponding incidents to the multi-
   layer,multi-domain management system, then such management system
   comprehensively analyzes the topology relationship and service
   relationship between the root causes of both layers.  The inner
   relationship among the alarms will be identified and finally the root
   cause will be located among multiple layers.  By cooperating with the
   integrated Optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) within the
   network device, we can determine the target optical exchange station
   before site visits.  Therefore, the overall fault demarcation process
   is simplified and automated, the analyze result could be reported and
   visualized in time.  In this case, operation teams only have to
   confirm the analyze result and dispatch site engineers to perform
   relative maintenance actions (e.g., splice fiber) based on the root
   cause.

3.4.  Security Events Automated Noise Reduction based on Situation
      Awareness

   In the continuous data driven monitoring, tools used by the Security
   Operation Center (SoC) scan the network 24/7 to flag any
   abnormalities or suspicious activities.  As the SoC adds more tools
   for security events detection, the volume of security events or
   alerts grows continually. the overwhelming number of threat alerts
   can cause threat fatigue.  In addition, many of these alerts do not
   provide sufficient intelligence, context to investigate, or are false
   positives.  False positives not only drain time and resources, but
   can also distract teams from real incidents.

   With the help of the network incident management, BERT(Bidirectional
   Encoder Representations from Transformers) [BERT] classifier can be
   adopted to analyses the suspicious activity and understands the
   significance of the gathered data (through both facts and inferences)
   and help operation and maintenance engineers focus on handling
   important security events and avoid wasting resources on false
   alerts, e.g., automatically determine whether 10,000 network security
   events are real incidents and give reasonable explanations.
   Progressively, Llama interpreter can be used to explain the reason
   why such alerts are picked out and marked significant, what could be
   the potential security implications that exist yet remain
   undiscovered.

             Figure 1: Network Incident Management Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates the network incident management architecture.
   Two key components for the incident management are incident
   management client and incident management server.

   Incident management server can be deployed in network analytics
   platform, controllers and provides functionalities such as incident
   identification, report, diagnosis, resolution, or querying for
   incident lifecycle management.

   Incident management client can be deployed in the network OSS or
   other business systems of operators and invokes the functionalities
   provided by incident management server to meet the business
   requirements of fault management.

   A typical workflow of network incident management is as follows:

   *  Some alarms or abnormal operations, network performance metrics
      are reported from the network.  Incident management server
      receives these alarms/abnormal operations/metrics and try to
      analyze the correlation of them, if the incidents are identified,
      it will be reported to the client.  The impact of network services
      will be also analyzed and will update the incident.

   *  Incident management client receives the incident raised by server,
      and acknowledge it.  Client may invoke the "incident diagnose" rpc
      to diagnose this incident to find the root causes.

   *  If the root causes have been found, the client can resolve this
      incident by invoking the 'incident resolve' rpc operation,
      dispatching a ticket or using other functions (routing
      calculation, configuration, etc.)

                Figure 2: Interworking with Alarm Management

   A YANG model for the alarm management [RFC8632] defines a standard
   interface to manage the lifecycle of alarms.  Alarms represent the
   undesirable state of network resources, alarm data model also defines
   the root causes and impacted services fields, but there may lack
   sufficient information to determine them in lower layer system
   (mainly in devices level), so alarms do not always tell the status of
   services or the root causes.  As described in [RFC8632], alarm
   management act as a starting point for high-level fault management.
   While incident management often works at the network level, so it is
   possible to have enough information to perform correlation and
   service impact analysis.  Alarms can work as one of data sources of
   incident management and may be aggregated into few amount of
   incidents by correlation analysis, network service impact and root
   causes may be determined during incident process.

   Incident also contains some related alarms,if needed users can query
   the information of alarms by alarm management interface [RFC8632].
   In some cases, e.g., cutover scenario, incident server may use alarm
   management interface [RFC8632] to shelve some alarms.

   Alarm management may keep the original process, alarms are reported
   from network to network controller or analytics and then reported to
   upper layer system (e.g., OSS).  Upper layer system may store these
   alarms and provide the information for fault analysis (e.g., deeper
   analysis based on incident).

   Compared with alarm management, incident management provides not only
   incident reporting but also diagnosis and resolution functions, it's
   possible to support self-healing and may be helpful for single-domain
   closed-loop control.

   Incident management is not a substitute for alarm management.
   Instead, they can work together to implement fault management.

4.2.  Interworking with SAIN

   SAIN [RFC9417] defines an architecture of network service assurance.

                      Figure 3: Interworking with SAIN

   A network service can be decomposed into some sub-services, and some
   metrics can be monitored for sub-services.  For example, a tunnel
   service can be decomposed into some peer tunnel interface sub-
   services and IP connectivity sub-service.  If some metrics are
   evaluated to indicate unhealthy for specific sub-service, some
   symptoms will be present.  Incident server may identify the incident
   based on symptoms, and then report it to upper layer system.  So,
   SAIN can be one way to identify incident, services, sub-services and
   metrics can be preconfigured via APIs defined by service assurance
   YANG model [RFC9418] and incident will be reported if symptoms match
   the condition of incident.

4.3.  Relationship with RFC8969

   [RFC8969] defines a framework for network automation using YANG, this
   framework breaks down YANG modules into three layers, service layer,
   network layer and device layer, and contains service deployment,
   service optimization/assurance, and service diagnosis.  Incident
   works at the network layer and aggregates alarms, metrics and other
   information from device layer, it's helpful to provfide service
   assurance.  And the incident diagnosis may be one way of service
   diagnosis.

4.4.  Relationship with Trace Context

   W3C defines a common trace context [W3C-Trace-Context] for
   distributed system tracing,
   [I-D.rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension] defines a netconf
   extension for [W3C-Trace-Context] and
   [I-D.quilbeuf-opsawg-configuration-tracing] defines a mechanism for
   configuration tracing.  If some errors occur when services are
   deploying, it's very easy to identify these errors by distributed
   system tracing, and an incident should be reported.

5.  Functional Interface Requirements between the Client and the Server

5.1.  Incident Identification

   As depicted in Figure 4, multiple alarms, metrics, or hybrid can be
   aggregated into an incident after analysis.

                     Figure 4: Incident Identification

   The network incident management server MUST be capable of identifying
   incidents.  Multiple alarms, metrics and other information are
   reported to incident server, and the server must analyze it and find
   out the correlations of them, if the correlation match the incident
   rules, incident will be identified and reported to the client.
   Service impact analysis will be performed if an indent is identified,
   and the content of incident will be updated if impacted network
   services are detected.

   AI/ML may be used to identify the incident.  Expert system and online
   learning can help AI to identify the correlation of alarms, metrics
   and other information by time-base correlation algorithm, topo-based
   correlation algorithm, etc.  For example, if interface is down, then
   many protocol alarms will be reported, AI will think these alarms
   have some correlations.  These correlations will be put into
   knowledge base, and the incident will be identified faster according
   to knowledge base next time.

   As mentioned above, SAIN is another way to implement incident
   identification.  Observation timestamp defined in
   [I-D.tgraf-yang-push-observation-time] and trace context defined in
   [W3C-Trace-Context] may be helpful for incident identification.

               Figure 5: Example 1 of Incident Identification

   As described in Figure 5, vpn a is deployed from PE1 to PE2, if a
   interface of P1 is going down, many alarms are triggered, such as
   interface down, igp down, and igp peer abnormal from P2.

   These alarms are aggregated and analyzed by the controller/incident
   management server, and then the incident 'vpn unavailable' is
   triggered by the controller/incident management server.

   Note that incident management server can rely on data correlation
   technology such as service impact analysis and data analytic
   component to evaluate the real effect on the relevant service and
   understand whether lower level or device level network anomaly, e.g.,
   igp down, has impact on the service.

               Figure 6: Example 2 of Incident Identification

   As described in Figure 6, controller collect the network metrics from
   network elements, it finds the packet loss of P1 and the path delay
   of P2 exceed the thresholds, an incident 'VPN A degradation' may be
   triggered after service impact analysis.

5.2.  Incident Diagnosis

   After an incident is reported to the network incident management
   client, the client MAY diagnose the incident to determine the root
   cause.  Some diagnosis operations may affect the running network
   services.  The client can choose not to perform that diagnosis
   operation after determining the impact is not trivial.  The network
   incident management server can also perform self-diagnosis.  However,
   the self-diagnosis MUST not affect the running network services.
   Possible diagnosis methods include link reachability detection, link
   quality detection, alarm/log analysis, and short-term fine-grained
   monitoring of network quality metrics, etc.

5.3.  Incident Resolution

   After the root cause is diagnosed, the client MAY resolve the
   incident.  The client MAY choose resolve the incident by invoking
   other functions, such as routing calculation function, configuration
   function, dispatching a ticket or asking the server to resolve it.
   Generally, the client would attempt to directly resolve the root
   cause.  If the root cause cannot be resolved, an alternative solution
   SHOULD be required.  For example, if an incident caused by a physical
   component failure, it cannot be automatically resolved, the standby
   link can be used to bypass the faulty component.

   Incident server will monitor the status of incident, if the faults
   are fixed, the server will update the status of incident to
   'cleared', and report the updated incident to the client.

   Incident resolution may affect the running network services.  The
   client can choose not to perform those operations after determining
   the impact is not trivial.

6.  Incident Data Model Concepts

6.1.  Identifying the Incident Instance

   An incident ID is used as an identifier of an incident instance, if
   an incident instance is identified, a new incident ID is created.
   The incident ID MUST be unique in the whole system.

6.2.  The Incident Lifecycle

   The incident model clearly separately incident instance lifecycle
   from operator incident lifecycle. o Incident instance lifecycle: The
   incident instrumentation that control incident raised, updated and
   cleared. o Operator incident lifecycle: Operators acting upon
   incident with rpcs like acknowledged, diagnosed and resolved.

6.2.1.  Incident Instance Lifecycle

   From an incident instance perspective, an incident can have the
   following lifecycle: 'raised', 'updated', 'cleared'.  When an
   incident instance is firstly generated, the status is 'raised'.  If
   the status changes after the incident instance is generated, (for
   example, self-diagnosis, diagnosis command issued by the client, or
   any other condition causes the status to change but does not reach
   the 'cleared' level.) , the status changes to 'updated'.  When an
   incident is successfully resolved, the status changes to 'cleared'.

6.2.2.  Operator Incident Lifecycle

   Operators can act upon incident with incident rpcs.  From an operator
   perspective, the lifecycle of an incident instance includes
   'acknowledged', 'diagnosed', and 'resolved'.

   When an incident instance is generated, the operator SHOULD
   acknowledge the incident with 'incident-acknowledge' rpc.  And then
   the operator attempts to diagnose the incident with 'incident-
   diagnose' rpc (for example, find out the root cause and affected
   components).  Diagnosis is not mandatory.  If the root cause and
   affected components are known when the incident is generated,
   diagnosis is not required.  After locating the root cause and
   affected components, operator can try to resolve the incident by
   invoking 'incident-resolve' rpc.

7.  Incident Data Model Design

7.1.  Overview

   There is one YANG module in the model, "ietf-incident", which defines
   technology independent abstraction of network incident construct for
   alarm, log, performance metrics, etc.  The information reported in
   the incident include Root cause, priority,impact, suggestion, etc.

   At the top of "ietf-incident" module is the Network Incident.
   Network incident is represented as a list and indexed by "incident-
   id".  Each Network Incident is associated with a service instance,
   domain and sources.  Under sources, there is one or more sources.
   Each source corresponds to node defined in the network topology model
   and network resource in the network device,e.g., interface.  In
   addition, "ietf-incident" support one general notification to report
   incident state changes and three rpcs to manage the network
   incidents.

          +--ro time? yang:date-and-time

   A general notification, incident-notification, is provided here.
   When an incident instance is identified, the notification will be
   sent.  After a notification is generated, if the network incident
   management server performs self diagnosis or the client uses the
   interfaces provided by the network incident management server to
   deliver diagnosis and resolution actions, the notification update
   behavior is triggered, for example, the root cause objects and
   affected objects are updated.  When an incident is successfully
   resolved, the status of the incident would be set to 'cleared'.

7.3.  Incident Acknowledge

   +---x incident-acknowledge
   |  +---w input
   |  |  +---w incident-id*
   |  |          -> /inc:incidents/inc:incident/inc:incident-id

   After an incident is generated, updated, or cleared, (In some
   scenarios where automatic diagnosis and resolution are supported, the
   status of an incident may be updated multiple times or even
   automatically resolved.)  The operator needs to confirm the incident
   to ensure that the client knows the incident.

   The incident-acknowledge rpc can confirm multiple incidents at a time

7.4.  Incident Diagnose

   +---x incident-diagnose
   |  +---w input
   |  |  +---w incident-id*
   |  |          -> /inc:incidents/inc:incident/inc:incident-id

   After an incident is generated, incident diagnose rpc can be used to
   diagnose the incident and locate the root causes.  Diagnosis can be
   performed on some detection tasks, such as BFD detection, flow
   detection, telemetry collection, short-term threshold alarm,
   configuration error check, or test packet injection.

   After the diagnosis is performed, a incident update notification will
   be triggered to report the latest status of the incident.

7.5.  Incident Resolution

   +---x incident-resolve
    +---w input
    |  +---w incident-id*
    |          -> /inc:incidents/inc:incident/inc:incident-id

   After the root causes and impacts are determined, incident-resolve
   rpc can be used to resolve the incident (if the server can resolve
   it).  How to resolve an incident instance is out of the scope of this
   document.

   Incident resolve rpc allows multiple incident instances to be
   resolved at a time.  If an incident instance is successfully
   resolved, a notification will be triggered to update the incident
   status to 'cleared'.  If the incident content is changed during this
   process, a notification update will be triggered.

7.6.  RPC Failure

   If the RPC fails, the RPC error response MUST indicate the reason for
   the failure.  The structures defined in this document MUST encode
   specific errors and be inserted in the error response to indicate the
   reason for the failure.

   The tree diagram [RFC8340] for structures are defined as follows:

     structure incident-acknowledge-error-info:
       +-- incident-acknowledge-error-info
          +-- incident-id?   incident-ref
          +-- reason?        identityref
          +-- description?   string
     structure incident-diagnose-error-info:
       +-- incident-diagnose-error-info
          +-- incident-id?   incident-ref
          +-- reason?        identityref
          +-- description?   string
     structure incident-resolve-error-info:
       +-- incident-resolve-error-info
          +-- incident-id?   incident-ref
          +-- reason?        identityref
          +-- description?   string

   Valid errors that can occur for each structure defined in this
   doucment are described as follows:

   incident-acknowledge-error-info
   -----------------------------------
   repeated-acknowledge

   incident-diagnose-error-info
   -----------------------------------
   root-cause-unlocated
   permission-denied
   operation-timeout
   resource-unavailable

   incident-resolve-error-info
   -----------------------------------
   root-cause-unresolved
   permission-denied
   operation-timeout
   resource-unavailable

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   '/incidents/incident': This list specifies the network incident
   entries.  Unauthorized read access of this list can allow intruders
   to access incident information and potentially get a picture of the
   broken state of the network.  Intruders may exploit the
   vulnerabilities of the network to cause further negative impact on
   the network.  Care must be taken to ensure that this list are
   accessed only by authorized users.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "incident-diagnose": This RPC operation performs network incident
   diagnosis and root cause locating.  If a malicious or buggy client
   performs an unexpectedly large number of this operation, the result
   might be an excessive use of system resources on the server side as
   well as network resources.  Servers MUST ensure they have sufficient
   resources to fulfill this request; otherwise, they MUST reject the
   request.

   "incident-resolve": This RPC operation is used to resolve the network
   incident.  If a malicious or buggy client performs an unexpectedly
   large number of this operation, the result might be an excessive use
   of system resources on the server side as well as network resources.
   Servers MUST ensure they have sufficient resources to fulfill this
   request; otherwise, they MUST reject the request.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  The "IETF XML" Registry

   This document requests IANA to register one XML namespace URN in the
   "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-incident
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

10.2.  The "YANG Module Names" Registry

   This document requests IANA to register one module name in the 'YANG
   Module Names' registry, defined in [RFC6020].

   Name: ietf-incident
   Maintained by IANA?  N
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-incident
   Prefix: inc
   Reference:  RFC XXXX
   // RFC Ed.: replace XXXX and remove this comment
