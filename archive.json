      "body": "- The phrasing \"..few amount of network incidents..\" is a bit odd.\r\n- There is a singular module defined in the I-D, but the abstract says plural \"modules\". \r\n- Recheck the reference at \"L3VPN services related with the interface will become unavailable [I-D.ietf-ippm-pam]\" or expand the text to correlate with the reference. \r\n- BCP14 template is repeated twice in Section 2\r\n- Section 7, please regenerate the tree, as it does not match the YANG module. For instance there is no leaf called \"csn\"...\r\n- Section 7.1 claims that there are two YANG modules \"ietf-incident-type\" and \"ietf-incident\" but the actual module in section 8 is a merged one.  \r\n- Section 7.{4,5}, some text needs to be added on the asynchronous nature of these RPC and how the incident client would learn about the output of these rpcs?\r\n- Section 8, update the WG details in the YANG module; the yang file formatting is off (use this command \"pyang --ietf --lint -f yang --keep-comments --yang-line-length 69 \" to fix that); \r\n- Is cross-domain == multi-layer (Section 3.3)? Think about making that clear.  Perhaps you should differentiate between inter-domain and inter-layer?\r\n- Is cause-name some well known cause or just free form string? (same for incident's name)\r\n- Please add a description for what are root-events and how it relates to root-cause \r\n- Section 9, security consideration is just the template, actual analysis is missing\r\n- Section 10, please fix the formatting of the IANA registry\r\n- Please run a grammar check tool\r\n- Please add JSON or XML examples\r\n",

The draft is silent on this, maybe some errors could be defined to identify the reason why the servers fails to diagnose/resolve a particular incident instance.\r\n",
