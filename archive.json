For instance there is no leaf called \"csn\"...\r\n- Section 7.1 claims that there are two YANG modules \"ietf-incident-type\" and \"ietf-incident\" but the actual module in section 8 is a merged one.  \r\n- Section 7.{4,5}, some text needs to be added on the asynchronous nature of these RPC and how the incident client would learn about the output of these rpcs?\r\n- Section 8, update the WG details in the YANG module; the yang file formatting is off (use this command \"pyang --ietf --lint -f yang --keep-comments --yang-line-length 69 \" to fix that); \r\n- Is cross-domain == multi-layer (Section 3.3)? Think about making that clear.  Perhaps you should differentiate between inter-domain and inter-layer?\r\n- Is cause-name some well known cause or just free form string? (same for incident's name)\r\n- Please add a description for what are root-events and how it relates to root-cause \r\n- Section 9, security consideration is just the template, actual analysis is missing\r\n- Section 10, please fix the formatting of the IANA registry\r\n- Please run a grammar check tool\r\n- Please add JSON or XML examples\r\n",

This pull request is a bit old, which means that it isn't necessarily how you would do it today.\r\n\r\nYou might do better with integrating the lint more tightly as I describe [in the documentation](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/TOOLS.md#linting-tools). For something like pyang-lint, you can get automated installation as described on the same page or in [the sourcecode](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/deps.mk).\r\n\r\nThat means that you would only need to create a requirements.txt and add a rule approximately like:\r\n\r\nyang-files := $(wildcard *.yang)\r\nyang-file-markers := $(patsubst %.yang,.%.yang-lint,$(yang-files))\r\n.PHONY: pyang-lint\r\npyang-lint: $(pyang-lint-files)\r\n.%.yang-lint: %.yang $(DEPS_FILES)\r\n        pyang-lint $< | tee $@\r\nlint:: pyang-lint\r\n(I haven't debugged the above, but I hope that it is clear enough.)",
